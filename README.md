# L4D2_Torment

L4D2 mod where you get better gear to go to higher torments

root is a folder that can be compiled using VPK.exe once Left 4 Dead Authoring Tools has been installed in Steam, this is used to create Torment.vpk

Torment.vpk is the file that needs to be added to addons folder in "**\Steam\Steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\addons" to add modded gear in the game

Torment5.cfg is the file that needs to be added to cfg folder in "**\Steam\Steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\cfg for the host to exec in order to start a torment 5 game

This game can be ran once the host has downloaded Torment.vpk and Torment5.cfg into their respective folders, then boot L4D2 and in the console type "exec Torment5"

This can be played coop with Hamachi where clients connect to host game by typing in console "connect *host ip address*"

ps idk if this works with other addons so if anything weird is happening, delete your other addons
